## STAKEHOLDERS COLLABORATION SYSTEM

### Abstract 
The challenge of handling the new project is to get familiar with the latest technology which is essential for the project. To tackle the project in an efficient and optimal manner we need some technical support. Our proposed system tackles this problem by suggesting a user for collaboration, the topics the user might be interested to learn according to the topics learnt by other collaborators and trending topics using a bipartite graph. The bipartite graph contains two types of nodes: topics and projects. The project has attributes that are project name, user, stars, and forks. These attributes are used for further analysis.
